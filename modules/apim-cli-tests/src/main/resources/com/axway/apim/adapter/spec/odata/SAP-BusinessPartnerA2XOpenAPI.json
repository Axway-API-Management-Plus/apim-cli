In the delivery, the route proposal also takes the weight group into account.A particular customer always requires immediate delivery. You enter the appropriate shipping condition into the customer master record. This means that when you process orders for this customer, the system automatically proposes the express mail room as a shipping point and the quickest way to the airport as a route.If a shipping condition has been assigned to a sales document type in Customizing, this condition will be proposed by the system in the corresponding sales document. If there is no assignment, the system copies the relevant data from the corresponding customer master record of the sold-to party. You cannot change this value during delivery processing. The shipping condition will not be copied from the delivery into the shipment. The shipping condition is one of several criteria for selecting deliveries when you create a shipment.

The recipient can see this address in the sender information and can also reply directly to this address. The standard address is also transferred and can be used for incoming status notifications, for example.When sending using an RFC node in SAPconnect, the standard address of the communication type used is the one set as the sender address. The structure defined in the case of the RFC does not permit another address to be transferred, so the standard address is used for incoming status notifications too.The SAP users have the addresses of their exchange P.O. boxes in their standard communication type 'Internet Mail' as the home address and their Internet address in the SAP system as their standard address. Example:Home address: Bernard.Brown@Company.comStandard address: Bernard.Brown@System.Company.comSending using an SMTP nodeThe home address of the communication type 'Internet Mail' (Bernard.Brown@Company.com) is used as the sender address. If a reply is sent to this address the user receives directly in the exchange postbox.Sending using the RFC nodeThe standard address of the communication type 'Internet Mail' (Bernard.Brown@System.Company.com) is used as the sender address. If a reply is sent to this address, it arrives back to the SAP system.Example using a mail system groupThe users should get all messages in their Microsoft Exchange postboxes. In the SAP system the mail system group is activated for this using the setting \"Send Messages to the Home Address\".The address settings of the SAP users remain unchanged:Home address: Bernard.Brown@Company.comStandard address: Bernard.Brown@System.Company.comSending using an SMTP nodeThe home address of the communication type 'Internet Mail' (Bernard.Brown@Company.com) is used as the sender address.

Compared against the invoice entered earlier, the invoice just entered has different values in the characteristics Reference and Company Code. However, these characteristics are not checked due to the settings that you have made in Customizing. All other characteristics are the same. The system issues a message telling you that an invoice has been entered twice.If the characteristic \"Reference Document Number\" had been selected in Customizing, the system would have checked the reference document number and established that it was different from the invoice entered earlier, and it consequently would not have issued a message.Checking FI DocumentsThe system checks whether there are FI documents that were posted or parked with the Logistics invoice verification or with an FI invoice transaction.
